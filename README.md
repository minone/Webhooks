Key points:
- HMAC shared secret key for each url/destination.
- RabbitMQ for queue implementation for each url/destination.
- Postgres database for storing destination information.
- REST API (Spring, JAX-RS)
- Single Page Web Application (AngularJS, Bootstrap, HTML 5, CSS 3)
- Firebase just to store and show in the front end informations of attempts to post message in the backend.

# Short Description

- AMPQ
A new AMPQ queue is created for each registered destination. The AMPQ queue has two goals: to ensure the message ordering and provide scalability.

Our solution can be easily deployed on more servers to achieve a better throughput.

- BACKOFF exponential
During the message expiration window (24 hours), we retry to send it using an exponential backoff algorithm, ie, after every failure, we increase the time for a new attempt. The purpose of this solution is to reduce the network overhead, since a shorter time attempt would probbaly continue to fail.

For demonstration purposes, we limit the expiration window in 2 minutes (the requirement asked for a 24 hours window)..

- HMAC
We also generate a shared secret in order to sign the message content that will be sent to the destination. We are exposing it in the frontend only for testing purposes. Obviously, in a production environment this secret should be shared securely.

Our backend checks authenticity o every request.

- PostgreSQL
We use PostgreSQL to store the Registered Destination, but we could also use some key-value NoSQL Database (e.g. Redis) to retrieve the Destination and verify the message signature more quickly.

- FireBase
We use the firebase only to display in the frontend the operations taking place in the backend, especially regarding the attempts failed. Thus, firebase should not be considered as a key point in our solution.

- Frontend
We created the frontend to demonstrate the basic operations of the Rest API and to illustrate, via log, the backoff mechanism we have created. We use AngularJS, Bootstrap, CSS3, Html5 and Firebase client.

# A REST API is exposed with five basic operations, according to the requirements:

- /webhooks/post-message
Post a message

- @POST /destination
Creates a new Destination and also create a Queue to support it.

- @GET /destination
Retrieve Destination list

- @DELTE /destination/{destinationId}
Detele a specific destination

- @POST /callback
A dummy end-point just to test a succeciful request
